    "## Abstract\n",
    "In this project, I select 20 stocks from the companies recorded in north money to form a portfolio. The idea behind is to use histroy data to predict which stock would perform better based on four indicators: net flow, money rank, change in price and moving average crossover times. The evalution method is comparing my portfolio with the benchmark HS300."

    "To avoid spending too much time on getting data from tushare api, I store the each year's top 10 stocks with how many times they appear on the list into txt files(from 2016 to 2019).Then, I select the top 35 stocks each year with highest frequency. A total of 61 stocks is chosen.\n",

    "## III. Creating Portfolio\n",
    "The main idea of creating this portfolio is using past 4 years' north money stock data to predict how they would perform in the following 2 months. In this project, I use data since 2016 to 2019 to predict performence from the beginning of January 2020 to the end of February 2020. With 4 indicators having different weights, a final score is calculated for each stock. 20 stocks with highest scores will be selected to form a portfolio.\n",
    "### 1. Net Flow\n",
    "    The net transaction amount is considered a important factor of a potential candidate is because net amount = active buying volume - active selling volume, a higher net amount shows that the market is optimistic about this company.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After getting 4 years' net amount, I take the mean of them and standardize to [0,10].\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2. Money Rank\n",
    "    The rank indicator is the funds rank of the company ib the top 10 stock list. As more funds would better support a company's long-term development, I include it as a criterion of portfolio. I use take the average of 4 years' rank.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3. Change in Price\n",
    "    The most obvious indicator of how a stock performs is its change in price. A positive value signifies that people can profit from this change. I sum up the 4 years' price change to generate a final amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Moving Average Crossover\n",
    "    The last indicator is using the moving average crossover strategy to determine how many times a buy signal appears on a certain stock. I count the total buy signal over 4 years for each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Total Score & Ranking\n",
    "    I assign different weight to each indicator: net amount(0.3), rank(0.2), change(0.3), moving average crossover(0.2). These value are based on the importance of the indicator.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When the final score is calculated, I sort the 61 stocks and choose the top 20 stocks into the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation method is computing the return value of the 20 selected stocks, and compare it to the HS300 stocks return.\n",

    "## V. Conclusion & Improvement\n",
    "The portfolio I have created does not win the HS300, one reason could be that I use past 4 years' data to predict next 2 months, instead using past one year's data to predict next year might be more reasonable. Another reason is that we have COVID-19 pandemic in the biginning of 2020, which may add instability to the market, and I have not take this factor into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some improvements that can be made to create a better portfolio is to add background information as a criteria. For example, when the currenct trend is a specific field like technology or new energy automobile, we can add stocks in related fields into the portfolio. Also, the portfolio can be created dynamically. It can be updated every two months, replacing poor stocks with new candidates."
